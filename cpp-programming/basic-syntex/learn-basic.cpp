// This program prints "Hello World!" and "I am learning C++" to the console
// It demonstrates basic syntax and structure of a C++ program
// The program uses the C++17 standard version
// To compile, use a C++ compiler with the C++17 flag, e.g.
// g++ -std=c++17 learn-basic.cpp -o learn-basic
// The program includes the iostream library for input/output operations
// It uses the std namespace to avoid prefixing standard library names with "std::"
// The main function is the entry point of the program
// The program outputs two lines to the console using cout and endl
// The program returns 0 to indicate successful execution
// Comments are included to explain the code and its purpose
