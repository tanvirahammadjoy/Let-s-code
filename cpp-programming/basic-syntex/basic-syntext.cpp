}

// This program prints "Hello, World!" to the console
// It demonstrates basic syntax in C++ including headers, main function, and output stream
// The program is written in C++17 standard
// To compile this code, use a C++ compiler with C++17 support, e.g: g++ -std=c++17 basic-syntext.cpp -o basic-syntext
// To run the compiled program, use: ./basic-syntext
// Ensure you have a C++17 compatible compiler installed
// This code is a simple example to get started with C++ programming
// It can be expanded with more complex features as you learn more about C++
// Make sure to include necessary headers and use the standard namespace for convenience
// Comments are used to explain the code and can be single-line or multi-line
